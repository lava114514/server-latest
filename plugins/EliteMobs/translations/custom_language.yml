zombie_necronomicon:
  summoningChant: Nor is it to be thought...that man is either the oldest or the last
    of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone.
    The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces
    we know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us
    unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the
    key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth.
    He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through
    again. He knows where They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread
    them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes
    know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features
    of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing
    in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance
    which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have
    been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with
    Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest
    and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath
    in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of
    the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraver,
    but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with
    seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only
    dimly. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at
    your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your
    guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet.
    Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now.
    After summer is winter, after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for
    here shall They reign again.

    the way to the arena to test his might against the toughest monsters from all
    the land! But before that, here's a rookie fighting some zombies.
  - wave=2:message=&8[Gladius] &fWould you look at that, they at least know how to
    wave their arms! That was just the warmup, let's start putting on some pressure!
  - wave=3:message=&8[Gladius] &fSo you think you know how to fight? Well this wave
    will put the &cheat &fon! Ha ha ha ha ha!
  - wave=4:message=&8[Gladius] &fAlright I guess they can take the heat! Ladies and
    gentlemen, strap on, we might be in for a show!
  - wave=5:message=&8[Gladius] &fI found this &cweird creature &foutside, and I thought
    putting it in the arena would be funny!
  - wave=6:message=&8[Gladius] &fSeems like you can handle small groups of enemies
    just fine, &clet's try scaling that up!
  - wave=7:message=&8[Gladius] &fSo you think you can truly challenge the arena? We
    shall see...
  - wave=8:message=&8[Gladius] &fNot bad, but what if every enemy is a &cmelee &fenemy?
  - wave=9:message=&8[Gladius] &fNice, nice, but what if they're all &cranged &finstead?
  - wave=10:message=&8[Gladius] &fCareful now, a &cbad doggo &fseems to have wandered
    into the arena! Where did it even come from?
  - wave=11:message=&8[Gladius] &fAlright folks we got animal control to deal with
    the bad doggos, we're back in business!
  - wave=12:message=&8[Gladius] &fIt seems like the audience is clamoring for &cmore&f!
    Well, let's give it to them!
  - wave=13:message=&8[Gladius] &fSeems like the custodians got bored and gave the
    arena creatures &2poison&f! Let's see where this goes...
  - wave=14:message=&8[Gladius] &fWell that was... boring! Whoever gave those guys
    poison is fired! Come up with something better next time!
  - wave=15:message=&8[Gladius] &fAnd here we have this year's prize-winning &4hog&f!
    It got first place for ugliness and meanness! Everyone give a round of applause
    for &4Mr. Oinkers&f!
  - wave=16:message=&8[Gladius] &fMr. Oinkers is now bacon! Here comes &cMr. Oinker's
    fans&f, flooding the arena to get their revenge!
  - wave=17:message=&8[Gladius] &fIt would seem as though our arena challenger thinks
    they have a shot! But can they deal with even more &cpowerful &ffoes?
  - wave=18:message=&8[Gladius] &fThe &cfencing club &fand the &carchery club &fare
    having a contest! Let's see which one does better!
  - wave=19:message=&8[Gladius] &fThe fencing club didn't so so hot, let's see what
    the &carchery club&f has for us!
  - wave=20:message=&8[Gladius] &fSeems like the archery club didn't do so hot either!
    It seems like our challenger has begun attracting the attention of some of our
    top gladiators! Introducing &2Zoltan, the Pride of the Zombies&f!
  - wave=21:message=&8[Gladius] &fUnbelievable! Seems like this rookie defeated Zoltan!
    Do we have a potential new champion in our hands?
  - wave=22:message=&8[Gladius] &fSpectators are starting to place their bets! How
    far can today's contestant go?
  - wave=23:message=&8[Gladius] &fDon't look away now, this wave's enemies all have
    &cwithering &fattacks!
  - wave=24:message=&8[Gladius] &fSeems like some pretty big arena names are starting
    to arrive to stop this challenger! Stay tuned!
  - wave=25:message=&8[Gladius] &fHere comes &bAgdluak&f, the archer from the Great
    North! Beware of its &bfrost&f!
  - wave=26:message=&8[Gladius] &fThat was a pretty cool fight! I am &cswarming &fwith
    excitement to see what's next!
  - wave=27:message=&8[Gladius] &fI've been told the arena grows harder! &cZombies
    immune to arrows, skeletons that freeze their opponents &f- what will they think
    of next!?
  - wave=28:message=&8[Gladius] &fIt's time to show off those &cfencing &fskills!
    Remember, it's all about the legwork!
  - wave=29:message=&8[Gladius] &fAnd now, let's have some &ctarget practice&f! The
    challenger is the target!
  - wave=30:message=&8[Gladius] &fA true arena champion approaches! The &2Southern
    Viper &fonce again seeks to &cpoison &ftheir enemies to death with his &cthousand
    poisons&f!
  - wave=31:message=&8[Gladius] &fThe Southern Viper has fallen! The crowd goes wild!
    What a day, ladies and gentlemen, what a day!
  - wave=32:message=&8[Gladius] &fI have been told that the arena custodians are done
    messing around and are staring to let loose! Can our challenger survive this?
  - wave=33:message=&8[Gladius] &fSeems like some enemies got their hands on some
    of Southern Viper's &cpoisons&f! You do not want to get hit by those, ladies and
    gentlemen!
  - wave=34:message=&8[Gladius] &fBobby, make sure you put 1,000 Elite Coins on these
    contestants dying for me - no, no, 1,000 Elite Coins - wait was this thing on?
    I mean, onwards to the next wave!
  - wave=35:message=&8[Gladius] &fLadies and gentlemen, what a rare treat! It would
    seems as the very &aWood League Jester &fhas stepped up to fight! What delightful
    &2tricks &fdoes he have for us today?
  - wave=36:message=&8[Gladius] &fWhat a lovely show ladies and gentlemen, give it
    up for &aThe Jester&f!
  - wave=37:message=&8[Gladius] &fBobby, how is my bet doing? What do you mean 10,000
    Elite Coins, I told you to put 1,000 on there! Uh, pump them, &cpump the powers
    up&f!
  - wave=38:message=&8[Gladius] &fBobby you're killing me here! Uh, dump some &cswordsmen
    &fon there, I need to deal with something real quick...
  - wave=39:message=&8[Gladius] &fWhat do you mean no refunds? I didn't even want
    to - ahem, I mean, a legion of &carchers &fhave come from far to show off their
    skills!
  - wave=40:message=&8[Gladius] &fLadies an gentlemen, for, uh, random reasons, I
    have invited the strongest fighter I can summon! Meet &4Crucios, the Bearer of
