zombie_necronomicon:
  summoningChant: Nor is it to be thought...that man is either the oldest or the last
    of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone.
    The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces
    we know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us
    unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the
    key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth.
    He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through
    again. He knows where They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread
    them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes
    know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features
    of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing
    in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance
    which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have
    been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with
    Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest
    and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath
    in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of
    the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraver,
    but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with
    seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only
    dimly. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at
    your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your
    guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet.
    Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now.
    After summer is winter, after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for
    here shall They reign again.

  - Something is deeply wrong with my husband.
  - He used to be a loving and caring husband and father,
  - but in recent times he has been focusing on documents he found in the basement.
  - He said it was for important research, something that could change the world.
  - I should've told him to stop when I saw how obsessed he was becoming.
  - He did... something... to the lighthouse - and
  - I fear the lighthouse has done something to him, too.
  - It morphed him into some kind of monster. He no longer recognizes us,
  - and has even attacked us when we tried to approach him.
  - At night, we can't sleep due to the wailing sounds
  - coming from the &dLighthouse's Basement&f.
  - He is suffering, and we are powerless to help him.
  - I know it's asking a lot, but do you think you could help us?
  questAcceptDialog:
  - '&a[Amavit]&f Thank you so much for accepting our request. I hope with all my
    heart you succeed.'

    Keeper&7&o out of his misery.'

    want to know.'

    with the issue. We need to make sure it is not an issue.'

  - wave=2:message=&8[Gladius] &fWould you look at that, they at least know how to
    wave their arms! That was just the warmup, let's start putting on some pressure!
  - wave=3:message=&8[Gladius] &fSo you think you know how to fight? Well this wave
    will put the &cheat &fon! Ha ha ha ha ha!

    putting it in the arena would be funny!
  - wave=6:message=&8[Gladius] &fSeems like you can handle small groups of enemies
    just fine, &clet's try scaling that up!
  - wave=7:message=&8[Gladius] &fSo you think you can truly challenge the arena? We
    shall see...
  - wave=8:message=&8[Gladius] &fNot bad, but what if every enemy is a &cmelee &fenemy?
  - wave=9:message=&8[Gladius] &fNice, nice, but what if they're all &cranged &finstead?

    arena creatures &2poison&f! Let's see where this goes...
  - wave=14:message=&8[Gladius] &fWell that was... boring! Whoever gave those guys
    poison is fired! Come up with something better next time!

    What a day, ladies and gentlemen, what a day!
  - wave=32:message=&8[Gladius] &fI have been told that the arena custodians are done
    messing around and are staring to let loose! Can our challenger survive this?
  - wave=33:message=&8[Gladius] &fSeems like some enemies got their hands on some
    of Southern Viper's &cpoisons&f! You do not want to get hit by those, ladies and
    gentlemen!

    skills!
  - wave=40:message=&8[Gladius] &fLadies an gentlemen, for, uh, random reasons, I
    have invited the strongest fighter I can summon! Meet &4Crucios, the Bearer of

  - Well you have certainly impressed me and most of the village.
  - I owe you an explanation friend. You see for the longest time we used to draw
    power from
  - the &cIce Elementals&f.
  - They would bless us with their power and in return any of us who would want to
    become a warrior or a hunter had to pass the &9Trial of Ice&f.
  - To pass the trial you had to climb the black mountain all the way to its eastern
    peak. And at the peak you would face the
  - '&cMinor Ice Elementals&f in combat.'
  - Should you succeed then your claim to become a warrior or a hunter was unquestionably
    your right.
  - If you failed...then...your energy and your being belonged to the &cIce Elementals&f.
  - This is how it was for the longest time. Until the &dBlood Temples&f influence
    grew in power.
  - Ever since then
  - the &cIce Elementals&f have been emboldened. Drawing power from them was now a
    risk.
  - Several of our people got corrupted and we had to jail them for our own safety.
  - And doing the trial became impossible, what faced you at the peak was something
    no villager could overcome.

    of their decaying bodies.

  - If you are looking for work I got some for ya.

  - amount of leather. So this won't be a quick job.

  - Well that is concerning. The sample you brought shows
  - that they are slowly being drained of their nutrients.
  - My hypothesis is that there is most likely a parasite
  - attached to them that is causing this. You should go
  - out there again and see if you can find any large
  - '&eGrowths&f on their bodies, and then cut them off'
  - and bring them back here.
  questAcceptDialog:
  - '&a[Plautia Suilius]&f I would only need two &eGrowths&f no more than that.'
