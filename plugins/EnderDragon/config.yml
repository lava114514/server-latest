#'weight'(edge): means using weight to decide which dragon(including default dragon) to spawn.
#'pc': namely 'priority+chance', dragons(except the default one) will be sorted in descending order of priority, and plugin will sequently try to spawn each dragon(according to respective chance). Once succeed, it will spawn and dragons behind it will be skipped. If all attempts fail, spawn the default one.
