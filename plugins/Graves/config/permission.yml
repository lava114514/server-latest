# Permission Override #
#######################
# Override config options for players who have these permissions, "graves.permission.{name}".
# If a player has multiple permissions, by group inheritance or manually given, options will be chosen from the top down.
# Meaning for example, since admin is at the top and if the player has this permission among others.
# The admin permission will always override permissions below it, therefor you should put your highest permission groups at the top,
# so they correctly override in a hierarchy, this prevents you having to define the same thing for each permission group.
# Remember you can copy options from the default section.
